Wearing Bellafiore's desginer high heels have one of the best qualities that models can wear down the runway. The bottom of the heels are not used with standard materials and Bellafiore has known this one thing for years, and that is why many models, designers prefer to use Bellafiore heels at most all runways held in Italy. Gigi Hadid chose to wear the summer collection heels as a way to prevent her from falling like she did in her last runway where she had to lean back and take a break from social media because she was so embarresed from the downfall. It was quite a hard time to comeback from such a downfall that she ended up using a local marketing agency to assist her with creating a quality comeback. As a result, the Marketing company provided her with Bellafiore's marketing agencies contact information. Because of this, Bellafiore's team was able to assist her with making her big comeback by wearing Bellafiore heels and featuring them in top marketing campaigns, commercials, and high-profile magazines. Bellafiore is a top designer in both the US and in Italy as well.

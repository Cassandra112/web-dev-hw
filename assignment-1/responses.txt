1. The web is different from the internet because the web gathers a variety of information. It is also a form of communication that connects information. Whereas the internet connects groups or people together through a cable.
2. The internet is a thick cable, or wire, that runs underground or through water, if need be. Computers connect to the wire through servers or routers to access the web. In order to access the internet, you must have an internet service provider. The ISP is the company, that basically, mainstreams your access to the web.
3. Directories are like pryamids, or family trees. There is a main folder at the top, and there are sub folders at the bottom. Directory name's resemble that of a family tree by naming files such as: grandparent, parent, and child.
4. VCS or version control is beneficial because it allows you to see all the changes that you have made from a project, and it saves each step, or change, that you have made to a file. Additions, modifications, and deletions are all recorded and can be revereted to previous settings. Lastly, multiple users can access the program at a time to change or modify as desired.

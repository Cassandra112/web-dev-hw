1. One head element is what is necessary for websites. I believe there is just one body area.
 
- The head element is quite important as it holds vital information as it used as the name of the page.  The information in the head is what search engines retrieve when users are surfing the internet. Information that the website holds is found in the body element. This is where users can find the main information and other types of things, such as more detailed information, links, or images that relate to the relevant topic.
2.  There are differences between structural and semantic markup. Structural markup consists of the outline, or structure of a document. For example, it provides necessary places for the headings, spaces, and paragraphs. Semantic markup can place a highlight on certain words and headings, such as numbers, authors, or works of art. They are highlighted with italics or bold or something similar.  
 
 3.
- I do have a lingering thought of why did the html name go from such a complex format to a very simple one.
- The work that I did in this cycle was, obviously, quite new. I learned how to add comments in html, revisited head and body elements, and learned how to add a hyperlink(s) and links whether it was to an external site or to an e-mail
- The one thing that struck me as different was adding html comments. I think it is neat that comments can be added to a website without the user seeing them, yet they can access them by viewing the page source.
- The problems that I experienced was finding a Readme file in my assignment -05 folder. I have no idea how it got in there. I am in the process of resolving the issue. I will either -drag and drop it to wear it belongs, or I will delete it in its entirety.

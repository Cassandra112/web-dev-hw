Assignment 09
Cassandra Soto


A system font is one that is on your computer, and it is does not need to be downloaded. A web font is a font that can be found on sites such as, Google fonts, and the code can be provided and added to the html file that is being created. A web-safe font is a font that does not divert from its appearance. Fonts such as Cambria, Georgia, and Times New Roman are web-safe fonts.

What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

The importance of having fallback fonts is valuable as it allows sites to default to another font in the event that the chosen font can not be implemented for one reason or another. For example, it is linked to a site that has a malfunction of some sort, I believe.


Summarizing the work you did this cycle, paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

In this assignment, I added fonts from Google Fonts by pasting in the code into my html file. I used 2 different fonts. I modified the document with different colors that are used in CSS. I added changes such as the weigh of fonts, the size of fonts, and updated the padding as well. In addition, I added a pseudo selector to the essay link. Leading was also included with the line-height feature.  

-What I learned was the pseudo elements and selectors. This was quite interesting, however, I could not nail some of the features of the pseudo elements and classes.  

-In this assignment I learned that utilizing colors that contrast are so important. I added too many whites, and I could not see my padding section come to light. After being frustrated with not finding the padding on my work, I rethought what I could be doing wrong, and it was using too many white (light) colors and the padding would not surface. I believe if I had been more aware of this small thing , it would have gained more time in completing this one project.

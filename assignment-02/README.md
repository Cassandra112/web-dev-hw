# Assignment 2
## Cassandra Soto
I am attending the University of Montana for my Bachelor's degree. For the past couple of years I have been taking courses online in Media Arts. One of the courses that I need to take is Web Design. By taking this course, I am meeting the requirements for the Media Arts program. This is the reason I am taking this course.

- I have learned how the internet truly works.
- I have learned that without wires or cables running underground that we could not send or retrieve information from across the seas.
- I have learned that it takes more manpower to get these wires and cables to connect and to be in the right place(s).

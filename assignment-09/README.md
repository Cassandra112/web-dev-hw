13. The universal element is applied to the whole page. For example, if I choose Times New Roman for my font and place it in the universal element section -the whole page will have this font. The element selector can be applied to certain sections such as 'headings;' the color, size, and other factors can be modified so all specifications made will match. Class-selectors allow those areas that are under the same 'class' to match the same specifications as input in the style.css file. Id selector types are similar to class-selectors by matching the same specifications noted to look the same across the board.
I believe I would choose the id selector because it is here that you can adjust the type of fonts that you would like to use in, what may be the body, of the webpage. If I chose the universal element to apply one font, I may not be satisfied with the outcome as 2-3 fonts on a page can make a webpage look more outstanding.

14. The color palette I chose are reflective of the 1950s. They are soft, yet the colors are bold (for that time at least). The colors I chose are a Mediumaquamarine, pink, and lemon chiffon.  




-Creating a basic webpage with the new found styles was quite interesting. I began to play with colors, which was great. I enjoyed finding a color palette and images that would tie into the webpage. I experimented with divs and adjusting sizes and position of images as well.
 in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
-I would like to discuss 'positioning' further. I believe if I could find more detailed information about this, such as a video tutorial or two I would be more confident in moving forward with projects like this.

-The biggest problem I had was sizing and positioning the images. I looked in my textbook and online for guidance and still couldn't manage to find what I was looking for. I finally went back to the website to find how the squares were positioned. Then I reviewed the CSS file and html file to see how the data was placed there. I followed the data there as if it were a template and then was successful in sizing and positioning the images on the 'webpage'.

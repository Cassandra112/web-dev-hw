        <p> Gardening has been one of my favorite past times. When I began gardening,
          I learned that it was very therapeutic and it was a productive hobby that
          I enjoyed. Many individuals enjoy gardening and it can be quite beneficial
          for those who like to be outside in the sun while keeping busy. If you are
          a begginer or an advance gardener, I would recommend going to:
          <p>
          <a href="https://www.almanac.com/">www.almanac.com</a>
          </p>
          to find more information on how to garden. If your'e a begginer to gardening, simply go to YouTube. They offer many videos on gardening. Simply search for:
          <p>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gardening+for+beginners">Gardening for Beginners</a> and many tutorials will pop right up.

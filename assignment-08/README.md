-My experience learning HTML has been very new. Starting of simple was a great way to begin. Heading, paragraphs, and body were some of the small steps I took in order to understand layout in html. The new things that I came across were styling, adding background color, and understanding formatting. Some sections were more difficult then others, such as adding in the table to the 'style' section. This had me going in circles for a hot minute. Utilizing the divs was interesting and I valued how it sectioned off areas so easily. I could not figure out how to center the pictures on the home page.

-I am very excited about learning about 'decorating!' I wanted to jump into in the assignment, yet I held back so I can move forward at the right time. Adding color, changing text, and tweaking the settings so it can be more artsy, is something that I am looking forward to.

  -My question regarding this assignment would be: How do I center the pictures on the homepage?
  -A brief summary of my work would include a lot of sitting down and paying attention. I made 3 pages for the website, which started off with the homepage, about page, and the contact page. I created links at the top of each page that navigate to the other pages that were created. I sectioned off areas using divs. I added a 'how to' section, a table, pictures, a map, an area to submit questions and/or concerns.
  -I learned how to center the divs, yet I did not learn how to center the pictures. This is one thing I would like to discuss further.
  - I mentioned how I had trouble adding the table. I could not find how to add the lines to the table. I looked at a previous assignment to see what I had done differently. I noticed that the code information was in the styling section. I copied the information and then pasted it in the style section in this assignment. The issue was resoloved and I was very relieved.

Assignment 12

Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary client was a couple looking for a wedding photographer. The needs that the photographer provided were listed amongst the 'service list.' There were multiple pages that users could access to find more information about the photographer, such as the 'about page' and more. There is also a submit your questions or party details so the photographer can get in touch with the future client.


What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

A 'display inline ' is the something that is hidden underneath another header. An 'display: block' is as simple as it sounds, it is nearly a solid box, if you add color to it, and it just stands. The display: inline is a one section that has the "item names" in one line that are essentially connected together.


Summarizing the work you did this cycle, paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

I learned that borders around information can enhance the look to sections. For example, I utilized borders on my contact page. It separated different areas and made it look a lot more better after it was added to the page.

I had problems adding pictures and placing them on the page where I wanted them to land. For example, I could not center the picture on the page. I also ran into some issues of placing text in one section and an image on the other side of it. 

 I solved the placing or positioning issues by going back to the website and reviewing the information. I positioned the image and text and was able to get them in a better place.

- One of the forms that I came across while I was online was a -contact us form.
purpose of the form is simply to contact the business. It is simple and to the
point. The font was creative and the background color was bright. There was a
'I am not a robot' element added as well. Another form I came across was one
that the user can fill out a form to register. The form included typing in
information and selecting a button for -male or -female. At the end of the form
the user can choose whether to reset the form or submit it. Both of the buttons
had different colors backgrounds.
- Text was used to input information such as: name, e-mail, phone number etc.
Selection input was placed in areas such as: male or female, indoor or outdoor
dining. Buttons were placed at the bottom of the webpage. For example, to submit
or reset the form, or to just submit the documents.
- Free Response
  - One question that I had is regarding the submit button. If an image for a
    submit button is utilized, is it necessary to add any more codes to the html
    file in order to activate it.
  - The one thing that I am glad that I achieved was making the table and the
    input forms. It was, simply said, neat to accomplish this task.
  - One of the problems I had was adding the "submit button." I solved the
    problem by going back to my textbook and searching for the answer. I simply
    utilized the information the book had and was able to accomplish adding the
    image as a button.

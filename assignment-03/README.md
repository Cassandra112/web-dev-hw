Browsers function by a user sending a request to the server, it then provides
the information that was requested. There is an interface that the users access.The interface is what you see on the webpage and its the place that has areas that you can. A rendering engine takes in all the information needed to display the webpage. The browser engine is the mediator for information between the user interface and rendering engine. The network retrieves data from the servers. Programming language interprets the data on the webpage. Data storage stores cookies. Rendering engines are key in browsers; there are different engines for different browsers. The engines read the html language and then interprets it. Next, it renders the information. Once rendered, the engine signifies that it is "interactive."

The browser that I used most is [Google Chrome](http://www.google.Chrome)

Markup language is uses tags to create order on for webpages and/or the internet.

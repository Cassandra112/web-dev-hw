Assignment 10

The margin is outside of the content, and border and it provides space from the sections. The border is right outside of the content area and can be displayed in different styles, colors, and widths.

Overall, I did reviewed some things that I had already done. Such as padding, borders, and modifying font sizes. I sized and positioned boxes. I modified borders by adding style to them. I created a site navigation bar, and added a psuedo element to the logo. Lastly, I modified the text style to the "site title." 

I learned that there are all sorts of shapes that can be added through html and css. I googled some shapes and I was quite intrigued at the coding and selections. I didn't use any, however, I thought it was neat and I am glad I know that they are out there.

I had a problem with adding the links to the top of the 'webpage.' I looked back at the homework site and reviewed how the sample was and utilized the formatting a bit, and then I adjusted them to meet my needs and the criteria for my 'webpage.'

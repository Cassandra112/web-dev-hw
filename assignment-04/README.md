The website that I visited using the Wayback Machine was yahoo.com. I can tell by the way it looked that it was much older. There are links on the right hand side that will immediately take you to common websites, such as Flickr, Facebook, and Yahoo messenger. The colors are very bland on the old website too. Once I went on to the current Yahoo website, the colors to the logo and photos stand out. The logo is much brighter, and the photos are vivid and more appealing. The side links are no longer there, and the layout at the top is a little bit different and more inviting as it is no longer crowded at the top of the search engine.

The GIT module was quite interesting. I had difficulty from the beginning to the end. Actually, I ended up deleting all my work because I could not seem to embed the images correctly. It is true that the folder names and image names must be exact, or like for like. The directions were very clear, from the video to the instructions on the website.

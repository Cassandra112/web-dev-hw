    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>On June 28, 1928 Nick Virgilio was born in Camden, New Jersey. He is known as an international poet and for his haikus. He served in the Navy, and was a university graduate. He obtained his Bachelors degree from Temple University, which is located Philadelphia. Nick wrote countless haikus in his time. He also co-directed a Haiku festival in Philadelphia. Because of the tragedies that Nick experienced in his life, he chose to write haikus to make his own life 'count for something' as he said. In early 1989, Nick breathed his last breath. He is still known today for his poetry and haikus. </p>
